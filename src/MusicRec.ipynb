\\nLike an old railroad bum by the track  \\nWhat a good life  \\nLiving outdoors  \\nLie in the grass and chew on a straw\\n\\n Twinkle, Twinkle little star  \\nHow I wonder what you are  \\nLike a

another morning without you.  \\n  \\nFinally when darkness falls  \\nCasting shadows on the walls  \\nIn the twilight hour I am alone  \\nSitting near the fireplace  \\nDying embers warm my face  \\nIn this peaceful solitude  \\nAll the outside world subdued  \\nEverything comes backs to me again  \\nIn the gloom  \\nLike an angel passing through my room  \\n  \\nMmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  \\n  \\nHalf awake in half in dreams  \\nSeeing long forgotten scenes  \\nSo the present runs into the past  \\nNow and then become entwined  \\nPlaying games within my mind  \\nLike the embers as they die  \\nLove was one prolonged goodbye  \\nAnd it all comes back to me tonight  \\nIn the gloom  \\nLike an angel passing through my room.  \\n  \\nI close my eyes  \\nAnd my twilight images go by  \\nAll too soon  \\nLike an angel passing through my room  \\n  \\nLong awaited darkness falls  \\nCasting shadows on the walls  \\nIn the twilight hour I am alone  \\nSitting near the

in angels  \\nSomething good in everything I see  \\nI believe in angels  \\nWhen I know the time is right for me  \\nI\\'ll cross the stream, I have a dream  \\n  \\nI have a dream, a fantasy  \\nTo help me through reality  \\nAnd my destination makes it worth the while  \\nPushing through the darkness still another mile  \\nI believe in angels  \\nSomething good in everything I see  \\nI believe in angels  \\nWhen I know the time is right for me  \\nI\\'ll cross the stream, I have a dream  \\nI\\'ll cross the stream, I have a dream  \\n  \\nI have a dream, a song to sing  \\nTo help me cope

\\nVoices call out to me, straight to my heart  \\nSo strange, yet we\\'re so well acquainted  \\nI let the music speak with no restrains  \\nI let my feelings take over  \\nCarry my soul away, into the world  \\nWhere beauty meets the darkness of the day  \\n  \\nWhere my mind is like an open window  \\nWhere the high and healing winds blow  \\nFrom my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  \\nI let them take me  \\n  \\nLet it be a joke, let it be a smile  \\nLet it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  \\nLet it be a tear, let it be a sigh  \\nComing from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  \\n  \\nSome streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  \\nRustling down an old alley  \\nAnd in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man  \\nIn some ancient valley  \\nI let the music speak, leading me gently  \\nUrging me like a lover  \\nLeading me all the way, into a place  \\nWhere beauty will defeat the darkest day  \\n  \\nWhere I\\'m one with every grand illusion  \\nNo disturbance, no intrusion  \\nWhere I let the wistful sounds seduce me  \\nI let them use me  \\n  \\nLet it be a joke, let it be a smile  \\nLet it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  \\nLet it be a tear, let it be a sigh  \\nComing from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  \\n  \\nLet it be a tear, let it be a sigh  \\nComing from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  \\n  \\nLet it be the joy of each new sunrise  \\nOr the moment when a day dies  \\nI surrender without reservation  \\nNo explanation, no questions why  \\nI take it to me and let it flow through me  \\nYes, I let the music speak  \\nI let the music speak\\n\\n I saw it in the mirror  \\nI saw it in my face  \\nThat I\\'m no longer needed  \\nAnyone can take my place  \\nI saw it in the mirror  \\nWhen I looked into my eyes  \\n\\'Cause something sure is wrong  \\nWhen this boy cries  \\n  \\nThis boy cries  \\n  \\nI saw it in the mirror  \\nMy head is hanging low  \\nAnd it ain\\'t too familiar  \\nWith the feelings that I show  \\nI know you say you love me  \\nBut I\\'m looking through your lies  \\nIt doesn\\'t really bother you  \\nIf this boy cries  \\n  \\nThis boy cries  \\n  \\nI never thought I could cry for you  \\nBut honey, I will miss you  \\n\\'Til the day I die  \\n\\'Til the day I die  \\n  \\nI saw it in the mirror  \\nI saw it in my face

\\nThen I had a very funny notion, yeah  \\nI really had to write a song about it  \\nAnd then I\\'m gonna sing it with my rock \\'n roll band  \\nAnd I bet the people gonna like it, yeah  \\nI know that everybody\\'s gonna shout it  \\n  \\nAnd what a dreadful mighty killer  \\nA big black wide gorilla  \\n  \\n[Chorus:]  \\nWe do the King Kong song, won\\'t you sing along  \\nListen to the music and it couldn\\'t go wrong  \\nWe do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along  \\nCan\\'t you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom  \\nListen to the rhythm of the King Kong song  \\n  \\nNow we can make the jungle out of any old place  \\nWe can make gorillas out of people, yeah  \\nWell who can tell a monkey from a monkey?  \\nSo people get together, gonna have a good time  \\nEverybody listen to the music, yeah  \\n\\'Cause what we\\'re gonna sing is kinda funky  \\n  \\nSo let your arms hang down  \\nAnd waddle all around  \\nLike a dreadful mighty killer  \\nA big black wide gorilla  \\n  \\n[Chorus]  \\n  \\nLike a dreadful mighty killer  \\nA big black wide gorilla  \\n  \\n[Chorus: x2]\\n\\n Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart  \\nNow there\\'s nothing at all that can keep us apart  \\nTouch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips  \\nThings that you do, and you know I\\'m crazy \\'bout you  \\n  \\nKisses of fire, burning, burning  \\nI\\'m at the point of no returning  \\nKisses of fire, sweet devotions  \\nCaught in a landslide of emotions  \\nI\\'ve had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this  \\nOh, I\\'m riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  \\nKisses of fire  \\nKisses of fire  \\n  \\nWhen you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong  \\nStill it\\'s making me scared that my love is so strong  \\nLosing you It\\'s a nightmare, babe, and to me it\\'s new  \\nNever before did you see me begging for more  \\n  \\nKisses of fire, burning, burning  \\nI\\'m at the point of no returning  \\nKisses of fire, sweet devotions  \\nCaught in a landslide of emotions  \\nI\\'ve had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this  \\nOh, I\\'m

the sky and there is fire in every kiss  \\n(Caught in a land-slide of emotions)  \\nKisses of fire, burning, burning  \\nI\\'m at the point of no returning  \\nKisses of fire, sweet devotions  \\nCaught in a land-slide of emotions\\n\\n No more carefree laughter  \\nSilence ever after  \\nWalking through an empty house, tears in my eyes  \\nHere is where the story ends, this is goodbye  \\n  \\nKnowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  \\nThere is nothing we can do  \\nKnowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  \\nWe just have to face it, this time we\\'re through  \\n(This time we\\'re through, this time we\\'re through  \\nThis time we\\'re through, we\\'re really through)  \\nBreaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go  \\n(I have to go this time  \\nI have to go, this time i know)

never easy, i know but i have to go  \\n(I have to go this time  \\nI have to go, this time i know)  \\nKnowing me, knowing you  \\nIt\\'s the best i can do\\n\\n I wasn\\'t jealous before we met  \\nNow every woman I see is a potential threat  \\nAnd I\\'m possessive, it isn\\'t nice  \\nYou\\'ve heard me saying that  \\nSmoking was my only vice  \\nBut now it isn\\'t true  \\nNow everything is new  \\nAnd all I\\'ve learned has overturned  \\nI beg of you  \\n  \\nDon\\'t go wasting your emotion  \\nLay all your love on me  \\n  \\nIt was like shooting a sitting duck  \\nA little smalltalk, a smile  \\nAnd baby I was stuck  \\nI still don\\'t know what  \\nYou\\'ve done with me  \\nA grown-up woman should never fall so easily  \\nI feel a kind of fear  \\nWhen I don\\'t have you near  \\nUnsatisfied, I skip my pride  \\nI beg you dear  \\n  \\nDon\\'t go wasting your emotion  \\nLay all your love on me  \\nDon\\'t go sharing your devotion  \\nLay all your love on me  \\n  \\nI\\'ve had a few little love affairs  \\nThey didn\\'t last very long and  \\nThey\\'ve been pretty scarce  \\nI used to think that was sensible  \\nIt makes the truth  \\nEven more incomprehensible  \\n\\'Cause everything is new  \\nAnd everything is you  \\nAnd all I\\'ve learned has overturned  \\nWhat can I do  \\n  \\nDon\\'t go wasting your emotion  \\nLay all your love on me  \\nDon\\'t go sharing your devotion  \\nLay all your love on me\\n\\n Long awaited darkness falls  \\nCasting shadows on the walls  \\nIn the twilight hour I am alone  \\nSitting near the fireplace  \\nDying embers warm my face  \\nIn this peaceful solitude  \\nAll the outside world subdued  \\nEverything comes back to me again  \\nIn the gloom  \\nLike an angel passing through my room  \\n  \\nHalf awake and half in dreams  \\nSeeing long forgotten scenes  \\nSo the present runs into the past  \\nNow and then become entwined  \\nPlaying games within my mind  \\nLike the embers as they die  \\nLove was one prolonged goodbye  \\nAnd it all comes back to me tonight  \\nIn the gloom  \\nLike an angel passing through my room  \\n  \\nI close my eyes  \\nAnd my twilight images go by  \\nAll too soon  \\nLike an angel passing through my room\\n\\n Spring in the air  \\nThe sun was shining  \\nStill the day was cool  \\nSaw her waiting for a bus  \\nAs she was going home from school  \\n  \\nLooking so cold  \\nI took her home and  \\nThat was just the start  \\nWe would meet the summer through  \\nAnd she was always in my heart  \\n  \\nLove has it\\'s ways  \\nLike seasons come and go  \\nAnd tomorrow there will be another day  \\nLove has it\\'s ways  \\nAnd so before you know  \\nWhen you turn around it may have gone away  \\n  \\nEarly that fall  \\nI knew I loved her  \\nMore than anything  \\nGave her everything I had  \\nShe even got a wedding ring  \\n  \\nBut in the end  \\nThe mind was restless  \\nAnd she had to go  \\nAnd the love I\\'d thought would live  \\nWas buried in the winter snow  \\n  \\nLove has it\\'s ways  \\nLike seasons come and go  \\nAnd tomorrow there will be another day  \\nLove has it\\'s ways  \\nAnd so before you know  \\nWhen you turn around it may have gone away  \\n  \\nLove has it\\'s ways  \\nLike seasons come and go  \\nAnd tomorrow there will be another day  \\nLove has it\\'s ways  \\nAnd so before you know  \\nWhen you turn around it may have gone away\\n\\n Do you remember the first time, and all of your sweet sweet talk  \\nAin\\'t heard it a lot since then love  \\nNow look at that guy, he\\'s making me cry  \\nHe leaves everybody and he only says goodbye  \\nBut if I would have to choose I wouldn\\'t let you go  \\nJust give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  \\nDarling I know  \\n  \\nWe gotta have patience  \\nLove isn\\'t just a sensation  \\nSome of the time it gets rough  \\nLove isn\\'t easy but it sure is hard enough  \\n(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  \\nGiving love is a reason for living  \\nBut a few things can be tough  \\nLove isn\\'t easy but it sure is hard enough  \\n(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  \\n  \\nFrom the first moment I saw you I\\'ve treated you like a queen  \\nI\\'ve given you lots of presents  \\nNow listen to that, just look at that cat  \\nYou\\'d think he was an angel but he\\'s talking through his hat  \\nBut if I would have to choose I wouldn\\'t let you go  \\nJust give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  \\nDarling I know  \\n  \\nWe gotta have patience  \\nLove isn\\'t just a

came  \\n  \\nI must have opened my front door at eight o\\'clock or so  \\nAnd stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  \\nI\\'m sure I had my dinner watching something on TV

must have read a while  \\nThe latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  \\nIt\\'s funny, but I had no sense of living without aim  \\nThe day before you came  \\n  \\nAnd turning out the light  \\nI must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  \\nAnd rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain  \\nThe day before you came\\n\\n I believe your new girl turned
